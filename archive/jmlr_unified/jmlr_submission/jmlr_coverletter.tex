Dear Editors:

I am writing to submit my manuscript ``Not All Factors Crowd Equally: A Game-Theoretic Model of Alpha Decay with Global Transfer and Risk Management'' to the \emph{Journal of Machine Learning Research}.

Our manuscript studies game-theoretic foundations of factor alpha decay, MMD-based domain adaptation for global market transfer, and crowding-weighted conformal prediction for tail risk management. This work is important because it provides the first mechanistic explanation of why factor returns decay heterogeneously, enables principled transfer of crowding insights across global markets, and offers distribution-free uncertainty quantification for portfolio risk management.

This paper is original work and has not been previously published in any conference proceedings or journal.

I suggest the following action editors and referees for our submission.

Action Editors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aaditya Ramdas, Carnegie Mellon University (aramdas@cmu.edu)
    \item Arthur Gretton, University College London (arthur.gretton@ucl.ac.uk)
    \item Stefano Ermon, Stanford University (ermon@stanford.edu)
    \item Zico Kolter, Carnegie Mellon University (zkolter@cs.cmu.edu)
    \item Percy Liang, Stanford University (pliang@cs.stanford.edu)
\end{itemize}

Reviewers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Emmanuel Cand\`{e}s, Stanford University (candes@stanford.edu)
    \item Yaniv Romano, Technion (yromano@technion.ac.il)
    \item Krikamol Muandet, CISPA Helmholtz Center (krikamol@cispa.de)
    \item Bryan Kelly, Yale University (bryan.kelly@yale.edu)
    \item Dacheng Xiu, University of Chicago (dachengxiu@chicagobooth.edu)
\end{itemize}

Our submission has the following keywords: factor investing, alpha decay, crowding dynamics, game theory, equilibrium analysis, domain adaptation, transfer learning, conformal prediction, uncertainty quantification, portfolio risk management, factor crashes.

As the corresponding author, I confirm that I have no conflict of interest with the action editors and referees I suggest above.

Sincerely,
