# ARCHIVED: ICML 2026 CW-ACI Paper

**Archive Date**: December 23, 2025
**Reason**: Merged into JoFE paper

## Why Archived

This paper was merged into the JoFE submission because:

1. **Same method**: Both papers describe CW-ACI (Crowding-Weighted Adaptive Conformal Inference)
2. **Duplicate effort**: Maintaining two versions of the same paper is wasteful
3. **Better venue fit**: JoFE Special Issue on "ML in Finance" is more appropriate
4. **Higher acceptance**: JoFE ~25-35% vs ICML ~5%

## What Was Merged

The following components from this paper were added to JoFE:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Proposition 1 (Marginal Coverage) | Merged |
| Proposition 2 (Uniformity Improvement) | Merged |
| Proposition 3 (Regret Bound) | Merged |
| Algorithm box | Already in JoFE |
| λ selection analysis | Partially merged |
