Standard conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guarantees under exchangeability, but factor returns exhibit heteroskedasticity that violates this assumption. We document that standard conformal prediction achieves only 80\% coverage during high-volatility periods versus the 90\% target---a gap of 10 percentage points. We propose Crowding-Weighted Adaptive Conformal Inference (CW-ACI), which adapts prediction interval width based on volatility signals. Using 62 years of Fama-French data across six factors, CW-ACI improves high-volatility coverage to 92\%---a statistically significant improvement for all factors (p<0.01). CW-ACI outperforms Gibbs-Cand\`{e}s adaptive conformal inference (85\% coverage) and performs comparably to naive volatility scaling (93\%). Our results demonstrate that signal-adaptive methods substantially improve conditional coverage for factor returns, with CW-ACI offering a principled approach grounded in the conformal prediction literature.
