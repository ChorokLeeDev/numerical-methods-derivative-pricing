## Key Research Contributions

### 1. Game-Theoretic Model of Crowding Decay
- Derives hyperbolic decay from Nash equilibrium
- Judgment factors decay 2.4× faster than mechanical factors
- Validates on 61 years of Fama-French data (1963-2024)

### 2. Regime-Conditional Domain Adaptation (Temporal-MMD)
- Respects financial market structure (bull/bear, high/low vol)
- Improves transfer efficiency: 43% → 64% across 7 developed markets

### 3. Crowding-Weighted Conformal Prediction (CW-ACI)
- Preserves finite-sample coverage guarantees
- Dynamic hedging improves Sharpe ratio by 54% (0.67 → 1.03)
- Reduces tail risk by 60-70% during major crashes
