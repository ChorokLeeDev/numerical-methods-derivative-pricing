THREE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FULLY INTEGRATED
================================================================================

The paper does NOT present three separate papers.
Instead, it presents a unified framework where each component enables the next:

    Game-Theoretic Model (Why crowding matters)
              ↓ provides mechanism
    Domain Adaptation (How to transfer insights)
              ↓ enables global application
    Conformal Prediction (How to manage risk)
              ↓ completes practical framework

RESULT: Integrated framework connecting three research communities
        (empirical finance, machine learning, risk management)
